    "Answer : Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used in data preprocessing to convert categorical variables into\n",
    "         numerical values. However, they are used in slightly different scenarios and have distinct characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Label encoding involves assigning a unique integer to each category in a categorical variable. This is often used \n",
    "when the categories have some sort of inherent order or hierarchy, but the numerical values assigned to them are not significant.\n",
    "For example, if you have a \"Size\" feature with categories \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large,\" you could label encode them as 0, 1, and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal encoding, on the other hand, is used when the categorical variable has a clear order or rank, and the \n",
    "assigned numerical values have a meaningful relationship. In other words, the numerical values hold information about the magnitude of \n",
    "differences between the categories. This method is suitable when the categories represent levels of a variable that can be quantified.\n",
    "Example: Consider a \"Education Level\" feature with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"Ph.D.\" Ordinal encoding\n",
    "might assign values 1, 2, 3, and 4 to these categories, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Choose Each:\n",
    "Use Label Encoding when the categorical variable has categories with no inherent order or when the order is not important for the\n",
    "analysis. For example, encoding gender as 0 and 1 is reasonable if there is no specific order between male and female.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Ordinal Encoding when the categorical variable represents levels with a clear order or ranking. This method is suitable for \n",
    "variables like education levels, economic status, or ratings, where the order of categories holds meaningful information"

    "2. Assign Numeric Values: Assign numeric values to the categories based on their calculated means (or medians). Categories with higher\n",

    "3. Replace Categorical Values: Replace the original categorical values of the ordinal variable with the assigned numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a machine learning project, you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding when you have ordinal categorical variables and want to\n",
