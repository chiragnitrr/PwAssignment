    "Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is assumed to be linear. This means\n",
    "that the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in an independent variable is constant across all levels of that \n",
    "independent variable.\n",
    "2. Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other, meaning that the value of one error should\n",
    "not provide information about the value of another error.\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors): The variability of the errors should be constant across all levels of the \n",
    "independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same across the entire range of predicted\n",
    "values.\n",
    "4. Normality of Errors: The errors are assumed to be normally distributed, which helps ensure the validity of hypothesis tests and \n",
    "confidence intervals.\n",
    "5. No or Little Multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with\n",
    "each other. High multicollinearity can make it difficult to isolate the individual effects of the independent variables on the\n",
    "dependent variable.\n",
    "6. No Perfect Linearity: There should be no perfect linear relationship between the independent variables. This is known as perfect\n",
    "multicollinearity and can cause issues in parameter estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset is a crucial step in validating the results of a linear regression\n",
    "analysis. Here's how you can assess these assumptions:\n",
    "1. Linearity: You can create scatter plots of the dependent variable against each independent variable. If the points roughly \n",
    "follow a straight line, the linearity assumption might be reasonable.\n",
    "2. Independence of Errors: This assumption is harder to directly test, but you can check for patterns in residual plots over time\n",
    "or across observations. If you observe any patterns, such as a funnel shape or a sinusoidal pattern, independence might be violated.\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: Plot the residuals against the predicted values. If the spread of the residuals remains relatively constant as\n",
    "the predicted values change, the assumption might be met. Alternatively, you can use statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan test.\n",
    "4. Normality of Errors: Create a histogram or a normal probability plot of the residuals. If they approximately follow a normal\n",
    "distribution, the assumption is likely satisfied. You can also use formal statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n",
    "5. Multicollinearity: Calculate the correlation matrix of the independent variables. If the correlation coefficients are close to 0 \n",
    "or moderate, multicollinearity is less of a concern. High correlation coefficients (close to 1 or -1) indicate potential \n",
    "multicollinearity.\n",
    "6. Perfect Linearity: This can usually be detected by calculating the correlation coefficient between pairs of independent variables.\n",
    "If the correlation coefficient is very close to 1 or -1, there might be perfect multicollinearity."
