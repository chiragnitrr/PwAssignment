    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both types of regression models used in machine learning for different types of tasks.\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the differences between the two and an example scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression: Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous numerical output based on one or more input features. It aims\n",
    "to find the best-fitting linear relationship between the input features and the output variable. The output of a linear regression \n",
    "model is a continuous value, such as predicting house prices, temperature, sales revenue, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression: Logistic regression, despite its name, is used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a\n",
    "binary outcome (usually 0 or 1). It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. Logistic regression\n",
    "uses the logistic function (sigmoid) to squash the linear combination of input features into a range between 0 and 1, representing \n",
    "probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "- Linear regression predicts continuous numerical values, while logistic regression predicts probabilities for binary classification.\n",
    "- Linear regression uses the least squares method to minimize the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values, \n",
    "whereas logistic regression uses the maximum likelihood estimation to maximize the likelihood of the observed data given the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario for Logistic Regression:\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you're building a credit risk model to predict whether a credit card applicant will default or not. This\n",
    "is a classic binary classification problem. Each applicant's features (such as income, credit score, debt, etc.) would serve as input,\n",
    "and the output would be whether the applicant defaults (1) or not (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, logistic regression would be more appropriate than linear regression. Here's why:\n",
    "- Binary Outcome: The outcome is binary (default or no default), which aligns with the nature of logistic regression that predicts\n",
    "probabilities for binary classes.\n",
    "- Probability Interpretation: Logistic regression provides probabilities that an applicant belongs to a specific class. This\n",
    "probability can be interpreted as the likelihood of defaulting given the applicant's features.\n",
    "- Sigmoid Function: The sigmoid function in logistic regression ensures that the output remains between 0 and 1, which is suitable\n",
    "for estimating probabilities.\n",
    "- Class Separation: Logistic regression models can capture non-linear relationships between features and the likelihood of default.\n",
    "It can learn decision boundaries that separate defaulters from non-defaulters effectively."

    "cost function to find the optimal parameters for the logistic regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Loss (Cross-Entropy Loss):\n",
    "The formula for the log loss (cross-entropy loss) in logistic regression is as follows:\n",
    "    J(θ) = -1/m * Σ [y * log(h(x)) + (1 - y) * log(1 - h(x))]\n",

    "- Compute Gradient: Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. The gradient indicates the direction \n",
    "of the steepest increase in the cost function.\n",
    "- Update Parameters: Update the parameters θ by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient. This step involves multiplying the\n",
    "gradient by a learning rate and subtracting the result from the current parameter values.\n",
    "- Repeat: Repeat steps 2 to 4 iteratively until the cost function converges to a minimum. Convergence is determined by predefined \n",

    "There are two common types of regularization used in logistic regression: L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge).\n",

    "L1 Regularization (Lasso):\n",
    "In L1 regularization, a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the model's parameters is added to the cost function. \n",
    "The L1 regularization term is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the parameters:\n",
    "    Regularization Term = λ * Σ |θ|\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "λ (lambda) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of regularization.\n",
    "θ are the model's parameters.\n",

    "The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate the performance of binary \n",

    "Here's how the ROC curve is constructed and how it is used to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Construction of ROC Curve:\n",
    "1. Prediction and Ranking: First, the logistic regression model predicts probabilities for the positive class (usually denoted as \n",
    "class 1) for each data point in the test set.\n",
    "2. Threshold Variation: The classification threshold is varied from 0 to 1. For each threshold value, data points are classified as\n",
    "positive or negative based on whether their predicted probability exceeds the threshold.\n",
    "3. TPR and FPR Calculation: At each threshold value, the True Positive Rate (TPR) is calculated as the ratio of correctly classified \n",
    "positive instances to the total actual positive instances. The False Positive Rate (FPR) is calculated as the ratio of incorrectly \n",
    "classified negative instances to the total actual negative instances.\n",
    "4. Plotting ROC Curve: The TPR is plotted on the y-axis, and the FPR is plotted on the x-axis. The resulting plot is the ROC curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of ROC Curve:\n",
    "- A perfect classifier would have a ROC curve that passes through the top left corner (TPR = 1, FPR = 0).\n",
    "- A random classifier (50-50 chance) would have a ROC curve along the diagonal (connecting bottom left to top right).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ROC Curve to Evaluate Logistic Regression Model:\n",
    "The ROC curve is useful for assessing the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes. It provides insights\n",
    "into how well your model performs across different threshold values. Additionally, the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) is a widely \n",
    "used metric to summarize the overall performance of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AUC-ROC: The AUC-ROC measures the area under the ROC curve. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "An AUC-ROC value close to 1 indicates a model with excellent discrimination ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selection of Threshold: Depending on your application's requirements, you can choose a threshold that balances sensitivity (true\n",

    "selection in logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Univariate Feature Selection:\n",

    "- Features with the highest test scores or p-values below a certain threshold are selected.\n",
