    "    Anomaly detection comes with its own set of challenges, and addressing these challenges is crucial for building effective anomaly\n",
    "    detection systems. Some key challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imbalanced datasets: In many real-world scenarios, anomalies are rare compared to normal instances, leading to imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "Traditional models may struggle to learn effectively from such imbalanced data, resulting in a bias towards normal instances.\n",
    "\n",

    "these changes and ensuring the anomaly detection model remains effective requires continuous monitoring and updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unlabeled data: Anomalies are often not explicitly labeled in the training data, making it challenging to create supervised \n",
    "learning models. Unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches are often used, but they require careful tuning and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Contextual understanding: Anomalies might not be anomalies in every context. Understanding the context of data is crucial for\n",
    "accurate anomaly detection. For example, a sudden spike in website traffic may be normal during a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Noise and outliers: Noisy data, outliers, or errors in the dataset can mislead anomaly detection models. Preprocessing techniques \n",
    "and robust algorithms are needed to handle such challenges.\n",

    "    Distance-based anomaly detection methods rely on the assumption that normal instances in a dataset are clustered together, and \n",
    "    anomalies are far from these clusters in terms of distance. These methods often make certain assumptions about the distribution \n",
    "    and structure of the data. The main assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assumption of Normality: Distance-based methods often assume that normal instances follow a certain distribution, typically a \n",
    "Gaussian or multivariate Gaussian distribution. Anomalies are expected to deviate significantly from this normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Global Structure: These methods assume a global structure in the data, meaning that normal instances form clusters, and anomalies \n",
    "are isolated points or belong to sparse clusters. The assumption is that normal behavior can be characterized by a central tendency,\n",
    "and anomalies deviate from this central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Euclidean Distance: Many distance-based methods, such as k-means clustering or k-nearest neighbors, assume that Euclidean distance\n",

    "outliers in this Euclidean space.\n",
